# Azure Wordpresson Virtual Machine Scale Set

This is a module to help build all the Azure resources necessary to deploy a highly scalable WordPress instance on a Virtual Machine Scale Set.
The WordPress instance is configured with an Azure Storage Account configured to act as an NFS and configured to connect to an Azure MySql instance.

This module has been inspired by this great walkthrough: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/fasttrack-for-azure/deploy-a-highly-available-and-scalable-wordpress-on-azure/ba-p/2507554
